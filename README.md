# HTML & CSS Course Assignment
Rainydays - This project is a responsive e-commerce website for selling jackets, created as a course assignment using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I worked on it in to separate assignments. In the first assignment i used only HTML and CSS, before adding functionality in my first JS assignment. It focuses on clean design, good usability and responsive layouts.
